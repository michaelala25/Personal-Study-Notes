## 1 Types of Logical Inference

There are two primary forms of logical inference, with a third established later on by Peirce. The first two are deduction and induction, concepts which have been expounded upon since as early as Aristotle. 

### 1.1 Deduction

**Deduction** refers to reasoning which builds a new conclusion out of pre-existing logical premises, through the use of logical formulas. A line of deductive reasoning is said to be "valid" if the result is true, assuming all the *premises* are true. A line of deductive reasoning is "sound" if it is valid, *and* all the premises are true.

### 1.2 Induction

**Induction** refers to the extrapolation of a set of data into a more broad, abstract predicate which the data exemplifies, a premise (from which, for instance, deductive reasoning can be performed). More generally, induction is the conclusion of a logical premise from a *body of antecedent knowledge*, which does not necessarily follow from logical predicates. The veracity of a deductive argument is based on the truth of the underlying premises and the validity of the deductive reasoning. The veracity of an *inductive* argument, on the other hand, is probabilistic, depending in part on the available data.

#### 1.2.1 Types of Induction

There are various types of inductive reasoning. **Inductive generalization** is the most common form; it proceeds from a premise about a sample to a conclusion about the population. **Prediction** is a form of generalization, extrapolating from the presently available data into the future. **Causal inference** is the conclusion of *causation* from an observed *correlation*, and is often considered a logical fallacy (without *further evidence* to support a claim of causality). **Argument from analogy** is exactly how it sounds.

**Statistical syllogism** proceeds from a *generalization* about a group to a conclusion about an *individual*. For instance, if a proportion Q of instances of a population P have property A, and I is an instance of population P, then it is a *statistical syllogism* to suggest that I has probability Q of possessing property A.

#### 1.2.2 Methods of Induction

**Enumerative induction** is a *method* of inductive reasoning, rather than a type of induction. It bases the veracity of a conclusion based on the *number* of instances supporting it, with more instances leading to more likely conclusions. Of course, the absolute number of instances observed is less important than the *proportion of the total population* accounted for by a sample. There is also **eliminative induction**, which supposes that a greater *variety* of instances is better supporting evidence of an inductive conclusion than mere *number* of instances.

#### 1.2.3 The Problem of Induction

Unlike with deduction, where a conclusion is either fully true or fully untrue, depending on the veracity of its predicates, there is a fundamental obstruction to the validity of induction, which is known as "the problem of induction". The *only* justification for the validity of an inductive argument is, itself, inductive in nature. Just because a person has seen 100 swans, all of which were white, does not mean that person has any credence to claim "all swans are white". We can only extrapolate that induction is a valid form of inference because we *often* see inductive arguments which maintain *some* form of validity.

Even stating that an inductive conclusion is merely "probabilistic" is only justifiable through inductive reasoning. As Hume writes in "A Treatise on Human Nature", probability is founded on the assumption of a general relation or distribution among the population, and the further assumption that a witnessed sample at least, by some metrics, adequately mimics those same metrics in the total population. Both of these are *learned assumptions*, derived through observation of the phenomenon of "statistical generalization". In short, "we often see induction work, so, by induction, we conclude induction mostly works."

##### History of the Problem of Induction

The earliest mention of the problem of induction in Western philosophy comes from the Pyrrhonists, who believed that induction cannot justify the acceptance of universal statements as true, though the generally accepted "first formal statement and investigation" into the problem was by David Hume, in his essay "An Enquiry into Human Understanding" (section 4).

It was in this essay that Hume put forth the distinction between "relations of ideas" and "matters of fact", the former being conclusions deduced from a set of premises and the latter being inductive conclusions drawn from repeated observation of the relation between causes and effects. One cannot *deductively* conclude an effect from a cause, as it relies on what Hume calls a "uniformity of nature" assumption.

In "A Treatise on Human Nature", Hume dedicates a subsection to the treatment of causes and effects, where he writes that reasoning alone *cannot* justify a connection between cause and effect, but rather the human mind "imputes" causation through the observation of "constant conjunction" throughout one's sensory experience.

### 1.3 Abduction

Charles Sanders Peirce identified a third distinct form of inference: **abduction**. Whereas with deduction and induction, the goal is to proceed *from* a premise P to a new conclusion Q, abduction goes in reverse: it observes a conclusion Q and attempts to find the *most likely premise* P which induces Q.

Peirce himself viewed abduction as a form of "guess", even admitting that the guesses of a well-trained mind are more likely wrong than right. But evincing the existence of this form of inference is the fact that these guesses are often *more likely to be correct* than *entirely random* guesses. There is something special about the thought processes involved in constructing a hypothesis - something which *elevates* a random guess to the status of a hypothesis.

#### 1.3.1 Abduction as distinct from Induction and Deduction

It's natural to wonder if abduction is some sort of special case of induction and deduction. It could be seen as *deduction in reverse*: deducing a set of *premises* from a given *conclusion*. It could also be seen as a form of *induction*: generalizing based on *past experience of cause-effect conjunctions* to a new scenario (e.g. "I've seen this conclusion a lot in the context of these premises, thus, by induction, these premises are the likely cause.")

In response to the first suggestion, abduction refers to the *process through which the search space of feasible explanations is pruned*; deduction doesn't explain *how* a reasonable set of hypotheses is disinterred, rather deduction (and induction) can be used to *verify* and *score* hypotheses relative to one another (as being "better" or "worse" explanations). The process of arriving at the premises from the conclusions in the first place, this sort of "guessing" procedure, is at the heart of abduction.

It is difficult to suggest the existence of reasonable logical rules and syllogisms from which one can reverse the premise-conclusion dichotomy. Consider the basic syllogism "Socrates is a man" and "all men are mortal", thus "Socrates is mortal". If we were to start from the observation that "Socrates is mortal", for instance if we saw Socrates die, all we can *deductively* reason from this is that "Socrates is not immortal". We cannot, from this, necessarily induce that "Socrates is a man", even though that is the likeliest explanation. We could perhaps *inductively* reason that Socrates is a man, *because* all men die (and Socrates possesses other man-like attributes), but as with all instances of induction the conclusion (which, in the context of abduction, is "the most reasonable premise")  is not a certainty. It is possible there are other explanations for why Socrates died (which are incompatible with the premise "Socrates is immortal").

In response to the second suggestion, one way in which abduction differs from mere "induction based on observed relationships between cause-and-effect" is that abductive thought processes can infer *new* collections of premises from *entirely new* conclusions. One may never have encountered a certain scenario before, but can still reason about and score likely premises. In other words, whereas induction is a sort of "static" process with respect to available observation, abduction is "dynamic", able to mold and adapt to interpret entirely new situations.

#### 1.3.2 Hypothesis

Under this framework, one can call a "hypothesis" the joint effect of *induction* and *abduction*, with *deduction* then being used to find reasonable criteria with which *falsify* the hypothesis.

#### 1.3.3 The History of the Term "Abduction"

Peirce introduced the term "abduction" in his work in the philosophy of logic, though it's commonly thought that Peirce himself didn't quite have a grasp on the concept before he gave it a moniker. He merely wanted to pinpoint a method of inference which he saw as distinct from both deduction and induction, without a formal (logical or otherwise) description of the method. Scholars point to the fact that "abduction" as Peirce initially envisioned it was probably a little different from the way the term is used in contemporary philosophy and psychology.
