## 1 The Baconian Method

In Francis Bacon's *Novum Organum*, but one fraction of his (never fully realized) magnum opus *Instauratio Magna* (The Great Instauration), Bacon sets forth a new formulation of the scientific method, which would so radically influence scientific pursuits that it would come to bear it's own name, the "Baconian method".

The *Novum Organum* was divided into two books. The first enumerated Bacon's issues with the current scientific methods, while the second included Bacon's plan to resolve said issues, a refurbished realization of the scientific method answering to Bacon's objections.

### 1.1 Book I - Bacon's Objections

In the first book, Bacon takes issue with the method of deduction, in particular the "syllogistic method". **Syllogism** is any deductive method of taking two premises and combining them to form a third (for instance, "Socrates is a man" and "all men are mortal", hence "Socrates is moral"). His main issue stemmed from the fact that deduction works on premises, and premises are at best rarefied abstractions of real-world phenomena. The conclusions drawn from relations of these premises may not accurately reflect the natural world, if for instance the abstraction fails to adequately compensate for the essence of a natural phenomenon.

In fact, the whole of the *Novum Organum* is a jab at Aristotle's *Organon*, in which Aristotle expounded upon his own scientific method which was *primarily* deductive in nature. Bacon instead, exalted the capabilities of *induction*, a method which he saw as overlooked, lain fallow in natural philosophy. Pervading the *Novum Organum* is an insistence on the fundamental importance of *observation* in developing an understanding of the world.

Another fundamental assumption common to Bacon's work was "reductionism" - the assumption that anything can be understood by breaking it up into a graph of interconnected "parts", each of which can be understood both independently, and by how they influence their constituent system (this is called "methodological reduction", as opposed to "ontological reduction").

One feature of the ancient Greek philosophers which Bacon *doesn't* object to are the **four causes** identified by Aristotle in *Organon*, which are essentially four types of answers to a "why" question. These are:

* **Material causes:** the constituent substances of an object influence its behaviour in response to stimulus.
* **Formal causes:** the arrangement, shape, or dynamics influence the behaviour.
* **Moving/Efficient causes:** the things *outside the thing itself* which influence its behaviour or conception (e.g. a parent is a "moving cause" of a child).
* **Final causes:** in short, the *purpose* of a thing, it's *telos*.

Bacon doesn't simply take them at face value, however. He redefines and reprioritizes them in interesting ways. In Aristotelianism the final cause is often considered the most important, but to Bacon it is typically the *least*, as it can in some ways "cloud empirical judgment". Instead, it is the *formal causes* which Bacon deems most valuable.

#### 1.1.1 *Idola*

Bacon also identified what he called *Idols of the mind*, which were impediments to the mind's objective reasoning. These include idols of the **tribe** (presupposing otherwise unsubstantiated regularities in nature), the **cave** (personal biases), the **market** (summarized as "veridical drift in abstractions": where words or terms or abstractions become inadequate or imprecise as they drift from their original meaning, now failing to coincide with observed truth), and the **theatre** (bias due to philosophical dogma). Idols of the market were, by far, the biggest nuisance to Bacon.

### 1.2 Book II - The Baconian Method

The "Baconian method" can be summarized as a "highly punctilious" form of eliminative induction.

First, one must identify a natural phenomenon or property (e.g. "heat") which they wish to study. Then create three tables. The first table lists all instances where heat is found. The second lists all situations *similar* to those in the first table but for which heat is missing. The third lists situations where heat can vary. From these three tables, the "cause" of heat should be precisely that which is *common to all instances in the first table*, *absent from all instances in the second table*, and *varies by degree in instances in the third table*.

It is perhaps not always necessary to explicitly write out the three tables enumerating legions of data, but rather to abstractly 

The Baconian method doesn't stop here, however. Any *finite* amount of data in the three tables would inadequately sample the real world, and Bacon knew this. Once a scientific hypothesis about a natural phenomenon has been *induced* from prior observational data, one should set out to *test the limits* of this hypothesis by gathering more data (perhaps data which is designed to *falsify* the hypothesis, as Karl Popper's method dictates).

### 1.3 Meta-analysis of Bacon's Outlook

Bacon was not just a philosopher, he was a highly successful lawyer. Some attribute his philosophical views to his legal acumen and pugnacity in the courtroom. He viewed science as a sort of *adversarial pursuit* against nature, where one grapples with it and "tests it" with challenges to it's supposed axiomatic structure, until man has subdued it into perspicuity. In fact, Bacon saw most of man's worthwhile pursuits as being aptly categorized into different types of "conquest": conquest over the self, conquest over others, conquest of other nations, or, the final and highest form according to Bacon, the conquest of nature, which he believed was the fundamental drive behind science.

Robert Merton, Dorothy Stimson, Richard Foster Jones, and Steven Matthews have written about the role of Puritanism in the reforms Bacon and others put forth.

### 1.4 Bacon and Descartes

It is interesting that both the Baconian method and the Cartesian school of epistemology emerged at about the same time, and yet are in many ways diametrically opposed to one another. Descartes, a mathematician, espoused the utility of deduction towards arriving at new truths about abstract objects, and believed that this *deductive* method was the *only* way one could arrive at **Absolute Truth**, a notion which Descartes believed was intimately connected with the existence of God. His "Meditations on First Philosophy" are an examination of which axioms one can take as Absolute Truth (for instance, "I think", or *cogito*), and proceeding from there (ergo I am). In this way, Descartes' method is described as **rationalist**.

* **Rationalism:** the epistemological view that holds that reason and deduction are the only sources or tests of the validity of knowledge.

Bacon, on the other hand, eschewed deduction (and arguably the *existence* of Absolute Truth) in favour of a pragmatic solution to these epistemological questions. Whereas Descartes' method was rationalist, Bacon is often cited as the father of **empiricism**.

* **Empiricism:** the epistemological view that knowledge comes only from sensory experience.

In Book I, Bacon rejects the notion that Absolute Truth can be attained at all. In general, the whole of *Novum Organum* is a fair bit more secular than Descartes' meditations.

#### 1.4.1 Ascent and Descent to Axioms

The Cartesian method can be conceptualized as a *descent to axioms*, whereby one *begins* by looking for the most *fundamental, indivisible, and irrefutably true* premises, which are generally the broadest axioms which may apply to a system. Only then can one deduce new relations of ideas as combinatorial constructions built from the premises - we *ascend* to higher, less general axioms.

The Baconian method, on the other hand, has a retrograde motion of axioms. From a small set of data, only *very specific* axioms can be reliably induced, from which one then *descends* to the most general axioms by aggregating new observations and adjusting the hypotheses accordingly.

### 1.5 Bacon's Anti-Copernicanism

Somewhat surprisingly (and comedically), Bacon was actually one of the last few anti-Copernicans, instead believing in a heliocentric model. The likely cause of this is his abject hatred for mathematics and geometric arguments - arguably a failure to avoid his own "Idol of the Theatre".
