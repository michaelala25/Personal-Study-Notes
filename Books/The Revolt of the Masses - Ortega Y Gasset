The Revolt of the Masses - Jos√© Ortega y Gasset

Chapter 1
	- Defines "the masses" as separate from "the minority"
		- "Society is always a dynamic unity of two component factors: minorities and masses."
		- The minorities are carved out from the set of all humans by means of _intentional exclusion_, via the development of specialized traits, common cultural/social attributes, etc.
			- They are individuals or groups
		- The masses are then best defined as what is left from this culling process
		- The "mass" is not a rigid line partitioning people - it is more of a fluid, temporal qualifier
			- Someone of a minority can become part of the mass for a time
			- A single person in a room could be considered part of the mass

		- Let me be clear, the mass is _NOT_ intended to be a subjective divide
			- A subjective divide would mean it depends on the observer to define - for instance, if I am in a room with another person whom I don't know nor wish to ascribe social value/meaning to (via a relationship to my own life, even fleeting), one might be tempted to include him as part of the "masses" - the anonymous background of humanity.
		- The mass is _not merely_ this anonymous background.
		- Here is what Ortega intends:
			- He claims that an arrogant member of a minority, specialized in one area, may wrongly believe his dominion extends beyond his specialization, and thus he is somehow entitled to preeminent democratic merit in all areas of social life. In overextending, he _becomes_ part of the masses.

		- This is _not_ a class division either

	- Claims that the masses are usurping the minority in their specialized roles
		- There are many functions of society which _must_ be attended to by minorities
		- The mass is somehow "advancing into the foreground of social life", "supplanting the minorities."
		- Claims this is the result of "political innovations of recent times"
		- The political domination of the masses are the "triumphs of a _hyperdemocracy_"

		- It's the difference between someone reading a book and trusting the author as an experienced teacher to convey new ideas/information to them, and that same person reading a book only to test the author's knowledge against their own preestablished beliefs/opinions
			- It is the replacement of humility with superciliousness
