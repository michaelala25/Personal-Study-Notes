# On Love - Aspects of a Single Theme

By José Ortega y Gasset

## Preliminary Remarks

* The preliminary texts which this book is founded upon (mostly in rejection of, such as Stendhal) seem to present distinctly heteronormative, cis-male views of love. But there are times where Ortega discusses the phenomenological features of love he believes are shared by *all* genders (which seem to be restricted to "man" and "woman", not uncommon for the time).

## I - Features of Love

Ortega opens up by expressing the sentiment that an analysis of "love" should not merely be limited to the attraction people feel between each other, but also aromantic love (as a parent of their child, a friend of their peers, etc.) and, what might be expressed in modern language as "passion" (love for the arts, sciences, Religion, etc.). He is concerned that much of the discourse around love focuses on "love affairs", and not on this broader phenomenon of "love".

* One might also interpret this book as an analysis of love, both as it is felt in the individual, but also as it is *depicted* in art and literature.

### The Distinction between Love and Desire

He also wishes to make a distinction between "love" and "desire." Desiring (to Ortega) has as it's end goal the *possession* of something, and thus dies when what was desired "enters our orbit". Love, on the other hand, is eternally *un*satisfied. Ortega considers desire a somewhat "passive" activity, and love, by contrast, an "active" one. When one "loves" something, the objective is to move *towards* the object of desire, to integrate oneself *with it* in order to become more complete. Desire, on the other hand, aims to integrate the *object* into the *subject*, and little else.

Another important aspect of love is that it transcends our traditional categorization of "taste" into appetites for pleasant things and revulsion of unpleasant/painful things. It is well-known that love brings with it great suffering and desperation, often which is *preferable* to the *tranquility* of one's temperament without love. This is present even in non-romantic forms of love (one who "loves a cause" may be willing to die for it)

- Well, I suppose it is tranquility along a certain axis, but that restlessness is somehow unique to love, independent of other forms of discontent or woe, and that restlessness is a crucial phenomenological feature of love. 
- There is, additionally, a "restlessness" which comes with certain desires, such as that which comes with desires that conflict with one's morals, and create internal moral turmoil (e.g. a drug addict desiring drugs, despite their awareness of it's detriment). There's something different about this kind of internal conflict which distinguishes it from the restlessness of love, but I'm not sure yet how Ortega y Gasset pinpoints this difference.

### Phenomenological Features of Love

Love certainly *engenders* desire, and is easily confused as desire upon it's inception. But beyond this, love creates a sort of "wound" in the heart, out of which pours a melancholic yearning for the beloved (I've definitely felt this towards women). An artistic facet of this yearning is being "psychically in motion", moving *toward* the object on a "continual march from our inner being toward another".

* Personally, I don't see love and hate as opposites of the same spectrum, but distinct processes; there isn't an analogous "directional desire" towards the object of intense disgust, for instance.

This "psychic motion" refers to motion towards the extremities (and eventually the outside) of one's "comfort zone" (this isn't the right word, but I don't have a better description of it just yet).

Another feature of love, as distinct from other forms of desire, is in it's "duration". Love is often experienced, or depicted, as a continuum, an *emanation* of attraction, desperation, and yearning, which subsumes more faculties than traditional desire. Desires are "instantaneous" by comparison. Once the *direction* of a desire is attained, and motion has begun, the *experience* of the desire begins to deaden, as that which one was aching for is now "entering our sphere". This is distinct from the experience of "love", which is a far more protracted experience by comparison. Ortega describes this as the "fluid" nature of love. Love is a sort of "flow, a stream of spiritual matter."

One last point: desire enjoys that which is desired, but contributes nothing to the object of desire, which is untrue of love. Love involves the *intentional preservation* of that which is loved, unlike desire which *consumes* that which is desired.

Key features of love: creates a "wound", causes "psychic motion", and is "fluid"

### Hate as the Opposite of Love

* "Hate", if interpreted as the antipode to love, is that type of revulsion which engenders "cleansing": elimination of the source of revulsion. In this sense, there **is** a "directional desire": the desire to eliminate. So, in response to my note above, hate, if interpreted this way, **is indeed the opposite side of the same spectrum which love lives on.**

## II - Love in Stendhal

Ortega seizes upon two literary figures for his initial analysis of love: **Pío Baroja**, and **Stendhal** (also known as **Marie-Henri Beyle**), particularly with Stendhal's work *De L'amour* (On Love). He also mentions **Hippolyte Taine** - relevant to Stendhal as Taine was a *munificent appraiser* of the psychological depth found in Stendhal's works.

Stendhal's "crystallization theory of love", in Ortega's eyes, suggests love is a sort of "grand mistake", whereby we associate with the beloved traits of perfection and beatitude, which are in reality untrue. Ortega sees this as *idealistic* (a philosophy which was *de rigueur* in central Europe at the time, thanks, in part, to the post-Kantian German Idealists); it supplants the object of love with a mere projection of the psyche of the lover.

First, Ortega rejects Stendhal's presupposition that love is somehow illusory or fabricated, and the perfect traits materialized through this "crystallization" process are confabulatory. The basis of Ortega's rebuttal is, what I might call, the **provenance argument**: there must be some *real thing* behind the spectre, which instantiates the adoration, no? Is our choice of beloved completely aleatory?

* Admittedly, I find his *argument* for this conclusion somewhat penurious, but can empathize nonetheless with the sentiment (without having read Stendhal, so it should be taken with a grain of salt).

Ortega also accuses Stendhal of merely "loving love", and quotes from Abel Bonnard's book *The Amorous Life of Stendhal*, that "all [Stendhal] asks of women is that they substantiate his illusions." In Ortega's eyes, Stendhal's beloved amounts to nothing more than a *pretext* for his hallucination. Bonnard also accuses Stendhal of "[loving] so not to feel lonely."

* Ortega goes hard on Stendhal, going so far as to say he has "never truly loved" nor "truly been loved".

Another critique of Stendhalian love is that it "reasons backwards, starting with the termination of love and proceeds in reverse." For Stendhal, how can love terminate if the object of affection has not changed? It must be the case that the *nucleus* of attraction, the conceptions of the beloved, were themselves somehow false, inaccurate, or misleading; a siren's call to an *inward* obsession, the salvation of one's own ego, rather than the integration of the self with the beloved, as is paramount to Ortega's love.

Essentially, Ortega sees Stendhal's theory of love as not addressing the *unity* of *lover and beloved*. Love, to Ortega, is a *holistic* experience, one in which the beloved is an *inextricable component of the experience*. Stendhal's theory is, on the surface, rather *insular* to the experience of the lover, using the object of affection as a mere pretext. Ortega says Stendhal also believes "love is made" and "love ends", both characteristics distinct to "pseudo-love".
