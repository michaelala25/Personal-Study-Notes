# Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy

By Hannah Arendt, edited by Ronald Beiner

Beiner was a professor of political science at the University of Toronto, and coeditor on numerous other modern works on Kant and political philosophy.

### Introduction

This book was recommended to me by a professor of ethics at the University of Waterloo, as a prerequisite text to understanding Heidegger's magnum opus "Being and Time". It consists of lectures given by Arendt at the same time she was working on he intended three-part project "The Life of the Mind", consisting of "Thinking", "Willing", and "Judging", only the first two of which she would live to see the completion of. The titles were intended to reflect Kant's three major critiques, which Arendt perceived as roughly paralleling:

* The Critique of Pure Reason
* The Critique of Practical Reason
* The Critique of Judgment

The lectures Arendt gave on this topic were largely based on the latter of these critiques.

### The Critique of Pure Reason
