- "Over the last century, the one solid truth established by psychologists is that the human psyche is constructed out of opposition, contradiction, and paradox. In problems of logic, contradictory statements cannot be true; in the psyche, _only_ contradictions are true. Self-image and shadow are Siamese twins, and the psyche is equally formed by the conscious and unconscious. Whatever appears to be true on the surface is linked to an opposite truth beneath the surface. What you see is _not_ what you get. We are who we appear to be _and_ our opposite or mirror image. One of Freud's best rules of thumb for determining what a person was unconsciously feeling was: "a negation is as good as an affirmation." Listen with the third ear and you will hear the echo."

- "The essence of the threat man feels from WOMAN is in its vagueness."

- "A man's journey in relationship to WOMAN involves three stages. IN the beginning he is sunk deep in an unconscious relationship with a falsely mystified figure who is composed of unreal opposites: virgin-whore, nuturer-devouring mother, goddess-demon. To grow from man-child into man, in the second stage, he must take leave of WOMAN and wander for a long time in the wild and sweet world of men. Finally, when he has learned to love his own manhood, he may return to the everyday world to love an ordinary woman.

In this first stage of his journey, or so long as he remains unconscious, the trinity that secretly controls man is: WOMAN as goddess and creatrix, WOMAN as mother and matrix, and WOMAN as erotic-spiritual power."

Woman as Creatrix
  - "Each of the three times I have been present at the birth of one of my children I have been overwhelmed by a sense of reverence. As the event of birth approached, the delivery room was bathed in a transcendent light and transformed into a stage for a cosmic drama. It was, quite suddenly, the first day of creation; the Goddess was giving birth to a world. Like men since the beginning of time I wondered: What can I ever create that will equal the magnificence of this new life?"
    - WOMAN, as creatrix, creates an inescapable challenge to a man to justify his existence - man merely "simulates" creation
      + technology, and AI, as a means for men to usurp the role of creatrix

  - "In response to the power of the goddess, man creates himself in the image of a god he imagines has fabricated the world like a craftsman working with a blueprint to shape matter into meaningful objects."

Woman as Mother and Matrix
  + what is the etymology of "matrix"?
  - She is our first teacher, and she takes precedence over all other teachers
    - "Her instructions remain within us like posthypnotic suggestion."
  - "In the degree that Mother remains a shadow presence in the life of a man, he will see himself and all women as if reflected in Mother's eyes. He will perform for them s he performed for her, fearing displeasure, courting approval. The size of his ego and the size of his cock will be determined by what he sees in the mirror she holds. And all the while he will imagine that her judgements are those of the flesh-and-blood women in his life."

  - Resolution of the Oedipus complex, according to Freud, was "if you can't beat them, join them": identification with the powerful father figure. He renounces his desire to be his mother's lover and identifies with the father.
  - But since the industrial revolution, fathers have spent less and less time (on average, of course) with their children, no longer present to teach his sons how to be men. In this case it is as if the boy "wins" the Oedipal battle

Women as Erotic-Spiritual Power
  - "For many creative men WOMAN is the muse and inspiration for their work. She possesses a semidivine power to call forth their creativity. She is the anima, the spirit and soul of a man."
  - "At the other end, the rapist confesses the same experience of the irresistible erotic power of WOMAN. His defense is inevitably "she tempted me.""

Saying Good-Bye to Woman
  - "So long as we define ourselves by our reactions to unconscious images of WOMAN we remain in exile from the true mystery and power of manhood."
  - "To love a woman we must first leave WOMAN behind."





Part II - The Rites of Manhood

* Man cannot be defined by his comparison to WOMAN

- Rites of Passage: Antiquity
  - Rites of passage in many societies are designed to take men away from WOMAN for long enough to discover the shape of man's world
  - Three parts, common to all tribes and peoples: separation, initiation, and reincorporation
  - Separation: disruption of the primal bond between boy and mother
    - Why the association between masculinity and pain? In many tribes, to be a man is to sacrifice oneself to the tribe (especially in warefaring tribes where the role of the man is to be a soldier/warrior, to leave behind the bodily pleasures and emotion/sensuality intuitively taught by mother), and a scar (such as circumcision) is a permanent reminder of one's sacrifice as a man: he is not merely an individual, but now, as a man, a member of the tribe.
      - "We gain manhood by the willingness to bear the mutilation imposed upon us by the ruling elders"
  - Initiation: the boy, now severed from WOMAN, is inundated with tales of past male heroes and villains, answering perennial questions such as "what is our role? What is our meaning in life?"
  - Reincorporation - Often given an insignia, sometimes even a new name

  + chronos vs kairos?

- In modern society, we are frieghted with the loss of these uniform gender roles and rites of passage, and instead shoulder the anxiety of not knowing.
- Despite this, modern society is still fraught with mythos - those ideas which are unanimously believed to be "the way things are", or at least accepted without much protest
- The first task of a man in defining his manhood is to distinguish his _autobiographical truth_ from the myths he has been fed



4 - The Rite of War and The Warrior Psyche
  - Main Question: Why, despite all of man's intellect and capacity for love, are we wont to pain, suffering, and combat?
    - Some biodeterminism at play, sure (testosterone, etc.), but we cannot ignore the role of social conditioning
      - Historically, the difference between men and women is that men are expected to be able to resort to violence when necessary, and the capacity, willingness to use, and adroitness of one's use of violence has always been central to our self-definition as men.
      - Conscription, for instance, "promises to make a man out of you"
      - Requires a breakdown of individuality, which is reflected in a number of cultures:
        - Christianity: authentic life involves the "imitation of Christ"
        - Initiates in the mystery cults became the god Dionysius
      - Even without being conscripted, many men test their manhood against their capacity for violence, especially in a war setting

  + Wilhelm Reich's "Character Armor" - and Character Analysis in general

  - Keen draws parallels between the seven defense mechanisms identified by Freud, and tactics of warfare
    - Repression, Isolation, Reaction Formation, Displacement, Projection, Denial, and Rationalization
  - Wilhelm Reich adds to Freud's analysis the observation that not only the mind, but the _body_ also responds, "living in the ambiance of threat and violence" (as the mind does).
    - The environment of war - crafted so as to imply that the enemy is always over the horizon ready to strike - creates men (and women) with physically tightened bodies, constantly under a stress response

  - Properties of the Warrior Psyche:
    - Simplistic black and white thinking about good guys and bad guys.
    - Willpower and action are preferred over ambivalence and contemplation
    - Identification of action with force
    - Paranoid worldview
    - Repression of fear, compassion, and guilt
    - Degradation of femininity (as a revolt of men's expendability to protect women and children)
  - Keen also gives a Jungian analysis of the Shadow of the Warrior Psyche

  * The acquiescence of men to the Warrior Psyche, and the resulting violence induced on other men and women, is the result of accepting the "war system"
  - However, "so long as the world is less than perfect the warrior can never wholly retire. This is the dilemma a sensitive man must face."
