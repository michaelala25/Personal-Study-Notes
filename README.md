# Personal Study Notes

This repo is a collection of notes I take while studying various topics. I like to read a lot of random things in my spare time, and the best way I've found to properly *take-in* what I'm reading is to write it down again in my own words. Sometimes I'll present it in a form which is easy to turn into Anki flashcards as well.

Sometimes you'll find lecture notes from class, but for the most part these are things I've picked up in my spare time.
