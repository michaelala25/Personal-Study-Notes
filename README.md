# Personal Study Notes

This repo is a collection of notes I take while studying various topics. I like to read a lot of random things in my spare time, and the best way I've found to properly *take-in* what I'm reading is to write it down again in my own words. Sometimes I'll present it in a form which is easy to turn into Anki flashcards as well.
