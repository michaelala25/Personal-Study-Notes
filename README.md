# Personal Study Notes

This repo is a collection of notes I take while studying various topics. I like to read a lot of random things in my spare time, and the best way I've found to properly *take-in* what I'm reading is to write it down again in my own words. Sometimes I'll present it in a form which is easy to turn into Anki flashcards as well.

Here you might find lecture notes from class, notes for talks I've given, or research articles I've published (or which are working towards being published). For the most part, these are things I've picked up in my spare time.
