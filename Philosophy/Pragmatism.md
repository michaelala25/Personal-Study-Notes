# Pragmatism

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Basic Tenets, Method, and the Pragmatic Maxim

First, let us state the intent of **pragmatism** as a philosophical method. The fundamental tenet of pragmatism is to *reject* the notion that the primary modes of communicating ideas in philosophy - the written word, logic, ratiocination, etc. - should aim to *mirror reality*; that is, represent it in utmost clarity, with perfect veridicality or coincidence with reality. Prior to pragmatism, the *merit* of a philosophical idea lies precisely in its ability to *capture*, *consolidate*, and *reconstitute* reality accurately.

Instead, the pragmatist's yardstick is *contextual purpose*: the merit of an idea lies in it's capacity to propose *actionable steps* upon which the listener can engage in pursuit of a purpose. Pragmatism opts for the *practical* ideas over the pursuit of *absolutely infallible* ideas, arguing that the latter is in fact an ouroboros endlessly circling back on and invalidating its own propositions; a never-ending, ever-reversing game of cat and mouse, which can never fruitful serve humanity or society.

Charles Sanders Peirce introduced the **pragmatic maxim**, which summarizes the core doctrine of the method of pragmatism:

* **Pragmatic Maxim:** "Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings,  we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception  of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object."

- This quote comes from Peirce's essay "How to Make Our Ideas Clear".

According to Peirce, metaphysics is *cleared up* by the application of the pragmatic maxim. He later expounded upon the pragmatic maxim as follows:

* "The *entire intellectual purport* of any symbol consists in the total of all general modes of rational conduct which, conditionally upon all the possible different circumstances and desires, would ensue upon the acceptance of the symbol."

In other words, "a thing is precisely equal to what it is used for, or what the consequences of its adoption are," where "thing" here could be an actual, physical object, the idea of an object, a concept or idea, or the word *representing* said object/idea in a given context.

### 1.2 Origins and History

The eminent progenitors of the theory are **Charles Sanders Peirce**, **William James**, and **John Dewey**. Many members of the original **Metaphysical Club** were influential in the development of pragmatism. The first usage of the term "pragmatism" was by Peirce, in his seminal work "Illustrations of the Logic of Science". As well as being particularly important to pragmatism, his essays "The Fixation of Belief" and "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" were inchoate formulations of what would become Peirce's foundational project in the philosophy of science.

* **Metaphysical Club:** a conversational philosophy club started by Peirce, James, and **Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.** (a future Supreme Court Justice) founded for a year in 1872 in *Cambridge, Massachusetts*. Other members who contributed to pragmatism include **Chauncey Wright** and **George Herbert Mead**. The name was chosen "half-ironically, half-defiantly" (according to Peirce), in response to, and rejection of, European metaphysical foundations.

Of particular note to the development of pragmatism was:

1. Peirce's application of **Alexander Bain**'s definition of "belief" as "that upon which a man is prepared to act", a theme which feature prominently in "The Fixation of Belief".
2. Chauncey Wright's influence on Peirce to elucidate a **phenomenalistic**, **fallibilistic** **empiricism** as an alternative to **rationalistic speculation**.
3. The rejection of **hyperbolic doubt** (also called **Cartesian doubt**) in favour of **realistic doubt**.

* **Phenomenalism:** The view that objects cannot *justifiably* be said to exist in themselves, but only as *perceptual phenomena* or *sensory experience*. It is a **radical form of empiricism**.
* **Fallibilism:** The epistemological view that *propositions concerning empirical knowledge* can *still be accepted* despite the admission that it *cannot be proven unequivocally*.
  * Often divided into **local fallibilism** and **global fallibilism** in contemporary epistemology.
* **Question:** How do phenomenalism, empiricism, and idealism all differ?
  * Empiricism is an *epistemological viewpoint* that objects can only be *understood* through sensory experience, as *bundles of sensory data* (see Hume's **Bundle Theory**). Empiricism heralds *measurement* of *properties* as the only reasonable source of information about the world.
  * Phenomenalism is an *ontological viewpoint* that *only* sensory experience exists.
  * Idealism is a *metaphysical viewpoint* that reality and our perception of it are *indistinguishable*.
    * A form of idealism known as **epistemological idealism** concedes that while an object may exist outside our perception, everything we can truly *know* about this object is <u>mind-dependent</u>, and thus is inextricably stained with the idiosyncrasies of those mind-dependent processes (creativity, spirit, cognitive capacity, bias, context, function, etc.).
    * Another form of idealism, **metaphysical/ontological idealism**, postulates that there is "something mental" (the mind, spirit,  ratiocination, etc.) *exhausts* physical reality; there is *nothing more* than the mind and it's machinations.
      * This is practically indistinguishable from George Berkeley's notion of "immaterialism".
      * A **question** naturally arises: whose mind?
  * Empiricism is perhaps most easily thought of as a *form* of idealism, which constricts our understanding of an object to <u>purely sensory data</u>.
  * It should be noted that the contexts of usage of these terms are legion, scarcely amenable to enumeration, and in each of these contexts they may have blossomed into new, pairwise incompatible concepts.

## 2 - Core Tenets

* **Coherentist theory of Justification** (also called **epistemic coherentism**) (not to be confused with the coherence theory of truth).
  This theory rejects the belief that all justification and knowledge must arise from basic *non-inferential truths* (in particular, non-inductive truths).
* 

**Question:** can you be a pragmatist while believing in the existence of Absolute Truth? Can you be a pragmatist and an idealist simultaneously?
