# Truth

Truth, in common parlance, is an utterance's propensity to coincide with reality, but despite it's commonly intuited meaning there are many unresolved complexities in discussing what it means for something to be "true".

## 1 My Thoughts on Truth

Last night I engaged in a little philosophical inquiry, where I began by asking the simple question "what does it mean for something to be true" and extrapolating from there. The exact path I took is irrelevant (and, to be frank, a little amateurish), but it led me to two conclusions which I think are important to clarify.

1. Many of the statements which we think of as being "declarative propositions" - formal logical statements with well-defined truth values - are merely *stand-ins* for other statements.

   * One of the issues I was struggling with was the notion of "correspondence", an oft-overlooked term used religiously in the "correspondence theory of truth". For instance, in the declarative statement "this table is brown", what does it mean for "this table" to *correspond* to a given table, and what constitutes "brownness"? I'm less interested in providing a rigorous definition of "table" and "brownness" (which I'm sure admit longwinded, exact definitions which would satisfy any staunch empiricist), and more interested in the general *process of correspondence* between words and things in reality.

   * The first thing one must realize is that the correspondence theory of truth is broadly based in intuition. The language of the statement "this table is brown" mirrors our perception of the world: there is a distinct physical object "the table" (as distinct from the floor, a chair, a bench, etc.) and a property the table possesses called "brownness" (which could perhaps be characterized by the wavelengths of light the table absorbs or reflects).

     Often a correspondence between a statement and reality requires context; it requires that we point to a table in reality and say "this table", upon which the physical object we descry becomes a *stand in* for "this table" in the sentence "this table is brown". Now there is no equivocating; the object, subject, and verb are representative of well-defined things in reality, and the truth value of the statement is *exactly* determined by whether or not reality *reflects* the logic of the sentence.

   * The second thing to realize is that many statements in everyday language are *synoptic* - they are *summaries* of more complex declarative statements. For instance, "this table is brown" could be synoptic for a much longer, much more complicated proposition which accurately delineates "table-ness" and "brownness".

     The *valence* of a synoptic statement (whether it is true, or false) is thus bifurcated into two different truth values:

     1. The truth of the underlying non-synoptic statement.
     2. The validity of the synoptic statement as a summary of the non-synoptic statement.

     This introduces a new element into the valence of a synoptic statement: the *anthropic factors* (human factors) involved in determining if a synopsis is "fair". A highly non-exhaustive list of such factors might include social, psychological, and cultural considerations. It is society which delineates table-ness, and distinguishes it from chair-ness, divan-ness, etc. It is a person's personal preference whether "maroon", often labelled a "dark shade of red", should fall under the concept of "brownness".

   * **Question:** What's to stop a sentence from being "synopses all the way down?" That is, when is a non-synoptic declarative statement "detailed enough" to be said to correspond with some fact of reality?

     Perhaps "this table is brown" is too simple an example to illustrate the notion of "synoptic propositions with well-defined truth values." It is ultimately meant to be a "corrective tool" for assessing the valence of seemingly-declarative statements that lack the formal rigour we expect of a statement with a well-defined truth value.

2. Not all statements, even in formal contexts, are expected, or even *required*, to have truth values "in isolation".

   * Consider the statement
     	"Impressionism was an art movement founded on the rejection of classicism." (A)

     You could perhaps argue that (A) is a synoptic statement. One could then torture themselves by attempting to find it's underlying non-synoptic counterpart, which might require drawing a perfect contour delineating "impressionist art" and "classicist art", among other absurd engagements.

     I now believe that statement (A), on it's own, doesn't even *have* a well-defined truth value. (A) is neither true, nor false, at least, not as a standalone statement. Rather, (A) is but one of a collective of statements, or a weak stand-in *for* such a collective, aimed at *consolidating* a complicated an ill-defined topic into abstract terms which can be 

     If you really want, you could go out and define impressionism as a "real thing"; a collection of people, beliefs, art, and events, windowed, perhaps, to a specific period in time, upon which one could "test" the valence of statement (A). But this is not the *intent* of (A). (A) is neither true, nor false. Rather, (A) possesses differing degrees of "accuracy", contingent on its relation to a larger body of utterances aimed at cultivating an abstract notion of the *real thing* that was "impressionism". (A) can be "accurate", "somewhat accurate", "somewhat inaccurate", or "inaccurate".

     The new question on everyone's mind is, then, what constitutes "accuracy"? Since this section is getting longer than I intended, I'll provide a brief answer: accuracy is the *possibility* of an abstract representation (as constructed from a conglomerate of utterances) coinciding with reality. An "accurate" statement is one which could be "fleshed out" into a true statement.

**Question**: is it possible that, in a correspondence theory of truth, the correspondence between reality and a declarative statement is not merely a correspondence between the words and reality (e.g. "table", "brownness", and "being a colour" corresponding to objects, properties, or causal relationships respectively found in reality), but also a correspondence between the *syntax of the statement* and the structure of reality?

## 5 The Regress Argument, and Responses

Suppose we have a statement $P_1$ which we hold is true. We might ask what justification we have for $P_1$, which will come in the form of a new statement $P_2$. We can continue this process inductively on $P_2$, with only three possible outcomes of this inductive process:

1. The sequence of justification is infinitely long, with each $P_n$ admitting a new justification $P_{n+1}$, for all $n\in\mathbb{Z}$.

2. The sequence is cyclical: there exists a minimal $n > 1$ such that $P_n = P_1$.

   2'. More scrupulously, one might say that $P_1$ is but one of many terms in the totality of $P_n$, and if we were to expand each of these other terms in $P_n$ and included them in our justification of $P_1$, we would arrive at a *finite* directed graph of propositions.

3. The sequence terminates, with some $P_n$ being "true without justification".

**Remark:** these three options are often called the **Münchhausen trilemma**, as coined by the German philosopher Hans Albert. Also known as **Agrippa's trilemma** (or the **Agrippan trilemma**), named after **Agrippa the Skeptic** by **Diogenes Laërtius**. **Sextus Empiricus** also reported a similar argument, but with five "modes".

* **Baron Münchhausen** was a fictional German nobleman created by **Rudolf Erich Raspe**, and is known for his amazing physical feats such as riding on a canon ball, fighting a forty-foot crocodile, and going to the moon. In one tale, Münchhausen gets his horse stuck in a mire, but manages to escape by pulling himself up by his own hair, hence the naming of the Münchhausen trilemma.

The problem with the first possibility is not that infinitary logics are inconsistent, but rather that an infinitely long string of propositions would require an infinite amount of time to justify (a proposition which takes zero time to justify might well be called "true without justification", thus reducing to possibility three), and so we could never conclude $P_1$ without making broad generalizations. Views that hold the first option as the only option are often labelled **infinitism**.

**Foundationalism** is the belief that possibility three is the only possible outcome, and that all true knowledge must be predicated on such "self-justifying statements". For instance, reducing everything to Descartes' *cogito ergo sum*, or perhaps a reliance on God to guarantee the truth of something fundamental. **Empirical foundationalism** holds that *sensory data* are self-justifying.

**Coherentists** respond by suggesting this is overly dogmatic. While accepting possibility two as the only possibility leads to a *form* of coherentism, this is not quite what most coherentists would contend (possibility 2' might be closer). In general, coherentism suggests that the justification of a proposition is a

What determines the **coherence** of a system? The key takeaway is that a system is *more coherent* if, when *additional, extraneous* observations are made, the system can *consistently explain them as well* (for instance, a system positing "the Earth is a sphere" is more coherent with observed data than "the Earth is flat", and "the Earth is an oblate spheroid" even more so.) Another common criteria for coherence is *simplicity*: a theory with a cumbersome number of auxiliary qualifiers and edge-case handlers is expected to be *more susceptible to inconsistency with extraneous data*.

**The Plurality Objection:** If coherentism is to be taken at face value, then it is hypothetically possible for two, or more, different coherent systems, possibly even *pairwise inconsistent* systems, to be accepted as "true". If "truth" is a proposition's propensity to coincide with reality, and there is only one "reality", then how can two externally inconsistent, internally coherent systems of belief be simultaneously true?
