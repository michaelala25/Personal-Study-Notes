Some preliminary definitions.

* **BCE** stands for "Before Common Era", **CE** for "Common Era", **AD** for "Anno Domini" (literally "in the year of the Lord" in Medieval Latin), and **BC** for "Before Christ". The terms **BCE** and **BC** are interchangeable, as with **AD** and **CE**. The **BC/AD** notations were introduced by 6th century monk **Dionysius Exiguus**.
* **BP** stands for "Before Present", with "present" generally taken to mean 1950 (has to do with radiocarbon dating, and how it became less viable after the use of nuclear weapons in the late 40s).

* The **Old World** consists of **Africa**, **Afro-Eurasia**, **Asia**, and **Europe**; those regions of the planet known to those inhabitants before the discovery of the **Americas**, which are respectively labelled the **New World**.
  * Also, in antiquity, called the "World Island", excluding major island groups (Japan, British Isles, etc.).
* The **Three-Age System** refers to the division of human history into three major time periods: the **Stone Age** (lasting roughly 3.4 million years, ending between 4000 and 2000 BCE), the **Bronze Age** (approximately 3300 BCE to 1200 BCE), and the **Iron Age**.
  * The **Stone Age** consists of the **Paleolithic** (**Palaeolithic**), **Mesolithic** (and, simultaneously in a different geographic location, the **Epipaleolithic**), and **Neolithic** periods.
    * The Paleolithic, also called the **Old Stone Age**, extends from about 3.4 mya to the end of the **Pleistocene** epoch, around 11,700 years ago.
      * **Pleistocene** is a *geological epoch*, rather than an archaeological one. Pleistocene was followed by **Holocene**, the current geological epoch.
    * The Paleolithic is further subdivided into three eras: the **Early** (or **Lower**) **Paleolithic**, the **Middle Paleolithic**, and the **Late** (or **Upper**) **Paleolithic**. 
    * The Mesolithic should *not be confused* with the **Epipaleolithic**. Both periods occurred around approximately the same times, falling between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods of the Stone Age. Mesolithic is used in reference to **Europe**, extending down to **Southeast Europe**, and almost *never* includes the **Near East**, where Epipaleolithic is more traditionally used. Unfortunately, these terms are *occasionally used as synonyms* (which they shouldn't be).
    * The Epipaleolithic (when restricted to the Near East) is generally dated from 20,000 to 10,000 **BP** (roughly 18,000 to 8,000 BCE).
    * The Mesolithic (when restricted to Europe) is generally dated from 15,000 to 5,000 **BP** (roughly 13,000 to 3,000 BCE).
    * The Neolithic, depending on where you are in the world, lasts from roughly 10,000 BC to 4,500 BC, marking the transition into the Chalcolithic period.
    * The periods generally overlap a bit. Paleolithic and Neolithic were introduced first, and then Mesolithic as an intermediary term, which immediately sparked controversy.
  * The **Bronze Age** is also called the **Chalcolithic** (also **Eneolithic** or **Aeneolithic**). The term **Eneolithic** is preferred by archaeologists when referring to Eastern Europe.
  * The end of the **Iron Age** is taken to be the beginning of the **historiographic record**, typically 550 BC with the establishment of the **Achaemenid Empire**, at least when applied to the **Ancient Near East**. Older dates are considered historical by virtue of the records of **Herodotus**.
    * This cut-off date is *despite* the fact that earlier records, dating well into the Bronze Age, are now known.
* The **Ancient Near East** is the geographical region housing many ancient civilizations which would now coincide approximately with the Middle East. The **Near East** is a transcontinental region in Western Asia, which encompasses roughly most of the **Fertile Crescent** and the **Levant Region**, including parts of **Turkey**, **Egypt** (mostly Northern, including the Sinai Peninsula).
* **Western Asia** consists primarily of Turkey, Iran, the Arabian Peninsula, and all that comes between.
* The **Fertile Crescent** is a crescent shaped region starting from modern day Syria and Lebanon, heading northeast up to Iraq and the southern border of Turkey, and back down along the **Tigris-Euphrates river system** into northern Kuwait and southwestern Iran.
* **Mesopotamia** (literally meaning "between two rivers") is the name given to the region bordered by the **Euphrates river** (to the south) and the **Tigris river** (to the north), in the northern part of the Fertile Crescent.
  * **Anatolia**, also known as **Asia Minor**, consists of the West Asian *peninsula* occupied by Turkey. The region west of Anatolia, across the Turkish Straits and the Sea of Marmara, is known as **Thrace** (or **Thrake**), which extends into modern-day Bulgaria and western Greece.

# 1 - Agricultural Revolution

**What:** The **First Agricultural Revolution**, also called the **Neolithic Revolution**, was a period of development of early societies where, within a relatively short timespan (relative to other biological epochs) a number of different ancient peoples discovered and utilized the powers of **agriculture**.

* **Agriculture:** The practice of cultivating plants and livestock.

Prior to this revolution, most early cultures were **hunter-gatherers**, foraging for food on a day-to-day basis with few fixed **settlements** (another distinct feature of the agricultural revolution). Settlement was necessary to cultivate crops over a longer timespan; people needed to be near the source of food. Part of cultivating crops also required **modification of the landscape**, including irrigation, deforestation, controlled flooding, etc.

The collection of developments which occurred during the revolution is sometimes called the **Neolithic Package**. Along with the aforementioned developments, the Neolithic package also includes:

* The cultivation of livestock (though one of the *downsides* to herding livestock is you have to constantly move around to find new grass to graze on).
* The **Neolithic demographic transition**, a phenomenon whereby sedentary societies engaged in agriculture saw massive population growth.
* More advanced pottery and art.
* More advanced shelter, including housing and architecture.
* **Depersonalized systems of knowledge** such as **language systems**, **mathematics**, etc.
  * In order to relay the successes of different agricultural techniques for future generations one might need to "put them somewhere" other than one's brain. In order to keep track of surplus crop production, number systems might be required.
* **Division of labour:** instead of spending your own time foraging for food, you could let others do it while you focused on other tasks such as *sowing*, *tilling*, *transport of harvest*, etc.
* **Trade** between different societies and tribes.
* **Property** and **ownership** (including of other people).

Some historians argue that division of labour,  trade, and property are the preconditions for much of what we see *wrong* with society today: violence between groups, subjugation, hierarchical systems of power which exploit the lower rungs, etc.

**When:** Approximately near the start of the **Holocene** geological epoch, which started 11,700 years ago.
